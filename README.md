# This repository has been abandoned as I have created my [dotfiles](https://github.com/AnapalOne/dotfiles). Therefore, this repository is no longer being used.

## A custom [xmonad](https://xmonad.org) configuration with clickable workspaces and easy naviagation, packed with tons of [pre-installed packages](https://github.com/AnapalOne/xmonad-packed#list-of-packages) for Arch Linux.

![xmonad](https://github.com/AnapalOne/xmonad-packed/blob/main/50s5zbz9gqu81.png "xmonad")
> **Note:** `xmonad.hs` will have configurations for packages not included in this setup. Generally these will not cause problems or decrease the performance of xmonad, but if the extra lines of code bother you, feel free to remove them if you like.

## Requirements
### git
``` 
pacman -S git
```
  - Verify: `git --version`

### yay
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git && cd yay
```
```
pacman -S base-devel
```
```
makepkg -si
``` 

## Installation
#### Download
``` 
git clone https://github.com/AnapalOne/xmonad-packed && cd xmonad-packed
``` 
#### a) Applying a specific config file to your existing xmonad/program
- If you want to only apply the xmonad config to your xmonad, simply copy `xmonad.hs` to `~/.xmonad/`
- If you want to only apply xmobar, copy `xmobar` to `~/.xmobarrc`
   - In this case, you will need to add some configs to `xmonad.hs logHook` in order for this xmobar to work. [Details found here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html).
- If you want to apply my configs to your programs, copy your selected config file (see `files` and `configs`) and apply it to your respective directory.

#### or b) Installing this config and packages from base Arch Linux/existing window manager
```
chmod +x ./setup.sh
```
```
./setup.sh
```
```
reboot
```

### Display manager / xinit
- use [xinit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xinit) to automatically start xmonad or a [display manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager) to cycle between window managers.
   - Read the wiki for more details: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xmonad#Starting

 ##### And you're done! You may edit any of these configs to your liking.

## Troubleshooting

### Some programs not found
- Packages may not install properly, so be sure to check and reinstall it after booting into xmonad.

### picom not working
- Try disabling vsync by changing the setting in `~/.config/picom/picom.conf`.
- An error may occur as a result of your graphical drivers not working/compatible with picom, so try installing [Intel](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics), [NVIDIA](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA), or [other](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hybrid_graphics) drivers depending on your GPU. 
- picom will **not** work with VirtualBox, causing a sort of [HOM effect](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hall_of_mirrors_effect). To fix this, open the terminal with `Super + Shift + Enter` and type `killall picom` (note that you won't see any activity, so you might have do it blindly). As a result, there will be no compositor running but xmonad can be used without it.
   - Currently working on a fix, stay tuned for updates.
